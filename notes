PID is that it is model-free. what this means is that you do not need to know the dynamic behaviour of the drone you will be flying prior to implementing the PID controller into the system.
NDI is extremely model-dependent, where the whole point of this method is more about changing the dynamic behaviour of your system by implementing dynamics you would like your machine to have.
